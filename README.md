### General Description
Yeezus Walks is a top-down third-person action adventure game filled
with fun and exciting obstacles to encounter. You play as Kanye
West's face and your goal is to cross a road with some cars and a
river to get to the magical 'Ye Zone, a place where Kanye can relax.
There are many dangers that lurk ahead, and getting to the 'Ye Zone
won't be easy. You, the player, controls Kanye West's Face with the
arrow keys. Pressing the 'up' arrow key correlates to moving up
by one space, 'down' to move down, 'left' to move left, and 'right'
to move right. That's it!

### How To Play The Game
CONTROLS: Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move yeezus around
	(up, down, left, right). There are no other controls.

GOAL: To reach the other side of the field, called the YE' ZONE.

OBSTACLES: Avoid the cars that move left and right across the road, 
	move on the the RickRoss and MacMillers to cross the river.

LIVES: You start with 3 lives. If you get hit by a car or fall into
	the water, you lose 1 life each time. If you lose all of your
	lives, you lose the game.
